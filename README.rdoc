== About This Project

This is a multi-tenanted version of Rails App Starter Kit (the master branch).
See its README for detailed information. Additional features:

1. Scope and subdomain based multitenancy (for maximum database flexibility)
1. Checks for maintaining tenant data integrity
1. Multi-tenancy in every aspect - even user registration emails!

== Scope and Subdomain Based Multitenancy

At the database and model level, multi-tenancy is implemented with "scopes".

Data to be contained to a single tenant have their corresponding models
belong_to the tenant, and the default_scope set to filter results to only the
currently active tenant.

This functionality is implemented using the acts_as_tenant gem. For more, see
https://github.com/ErwinM/acts_as_tenant

== Multi-tenant Users

The User model has been made multi-tenanted.

However, some applications may need users to be shared across all tenants. To
achieve this, certain changes will need to be made to the code:

1. Comment out the User#find_for_authentication method
